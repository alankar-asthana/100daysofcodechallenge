# Print all subsequences of a string

Given a string, we have to find out all its subsequences of it. A String is a subsequence of a given String, 
that is generated by deleting some character of a given string without changing its order.

### Examples: 
```
Input : abc
Output : a, b, c, ab, bc, ac, abc

Input : aaa
Output : a, a, a, aa, aa, aa, aaa
```
