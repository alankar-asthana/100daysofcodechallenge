There is a range given n and m in which we have to find the pair of prime numbers having difference of k. 

Output consists of single line. Print the pairs of prime numbers else print "No Prime Pairs".

### Example 1:
```
Input: n=10, m=99, k=10
output: (13,23) (19,29) (31,41) (37,47) (43,53) (61,71) (73,83) (79,89) 
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: n=10, m=99, k=9
Output: No Prime Pairs
```

### Constraints:
2<=n<=10001<br>
n<=m<=2000<br>
