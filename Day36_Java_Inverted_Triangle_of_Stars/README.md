Given an integer N, print an inverted isosceles triangle of stars such that the height of the triangle is N.

Example 1:
```
Input:
N = 4
Output:
*******
 *****
  ***
   *
```
Example 2:
```
Input:
N = 3
Output:
*****
 ***
  *
  ``` 

### Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function invIsoTriangle() which takes an Integer N as input and returns a vector of strings where each line represents lines of the pattern. For example, if N=2, the vector v = {"***", " * "}.

 
Expected Time Complexity: O(N)<br>
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)<br>

 

**Constraints:**<br>
1 <= N <= 100
