# Binary Palindrome

Take any integer and check if its bit representation is palindrome or not.

Note: Use bitwise operators.

### Example 1:
```
Input: 21
Output: True

Explanation: Bit representation of 21 is 10101. Reverse of bit representation is same as 10101. 
Therefore 21 is a binary palindromic number.
```
### Example 2:
```
Input: 39
Output: False

Explanation: Bit representation of 39 is 100111. Reverse of bit representation is 111001, 
which is not equal to binary representation of 39. As 111001 is a binary representation of 57. 
Therefore 39 is not a binary palindromic number.
```
