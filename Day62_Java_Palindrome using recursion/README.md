# Palindrome
A string is said to be palindrome if the reverse of the string is the same as the string. For 
example, “abba” is a palindrome because the reverse of “abba” will be equal to “abba” so both 
of these strings are equal and are said to be a palindrome, but “abbc” is not a palindrome.

### Example 1:
```
Input: x = "121"
Output: true
Explanation: "121" reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
```
### Example 2:
```
Input: x = "-121"
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```
### Example 3:
```
Input: x = "abbca"
Output: false
Explanation: Reads "acbba" from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```
